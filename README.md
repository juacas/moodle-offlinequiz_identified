# Identified forms for Offlinequiz #

IMPORTANT: This plugin need a version of mod_offlinequiz with the patch <https://github.com/academic-moodle-cooperation/moodle-mod_offlinequiz/pull/219> applied to enable the detection of third-party plugins.

This subplugin allow to generate a set of "Answer forms" with the names and identifiers of the students pre-marked.
The selection of students can be controlled by:

- Editing "attendance lists" in Offlinequiz itself.
- Checking "Students with access" to the activity according to restrictions and conditional access.

The pre-marked forms can be used to reduce human errors and to easy the physical control of the identities of the students in the classroom.
